# Neighborhood Segmentation in Big Cities: Toronto and Bangkok

In this project, we give comprehensive analysis on neighborhood characteristics of Toronto and that of Bangkok. Within the same cities, ones can understand social development, business activities, and other specific aspects in different areas via such analysis. Understanding these regimes will help us answer different questions including finding potential location of new business or where to install public facilities. The data used in the analysis includes locations and reviews of different places in the cities obtained from FourSquare API "Explore" request. Hierarchical and K-Means clustering algorithms will be used with the number of final clusters from the elbow technique. 

## Objectives

1. To segment different parts of the cities based on local characteristics including business types and number of business places
2. To understand the nature of the cities after the segmentation and justify such segregation using city information
3. To analyze potential business settings in different areas of the city and find out where new businesses might take place while taking into account the current operating business places in the areas

## Dataset

Data used in the preparation of the project was obtained from FourSquare API "Explore" request.

## Software and analytical approaches

All analysis programming is done using Python. Techniques in clustering includes Hierarchical and K-Means clustering algorithms
